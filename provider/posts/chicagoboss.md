I need to stop finding awesome projects to try out. [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) and [ChicagoBoss](http://www.chicagoboss.org/) look pretty freakin' sweet. Have to love some high-performance programming languages matched with a productive web framework.

I'm excited to create a demo project and dive into these. I'll follow up when I do.
