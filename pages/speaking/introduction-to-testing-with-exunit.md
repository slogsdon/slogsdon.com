From the meetup description:

> Bring your laptops for this workshop where we walk through basic testing using ExUnit, Elixir's built-in testing library.

The workshop led participants through [`TestThePlanet`](https://github.com/slogsdon/test-the-planet), a module-by-module look into leveraging ExUnit to perform unit and integration testing with Elixir's defacto and built-in testing library ExUnit.
